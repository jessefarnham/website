\f0\fs24 \cf0 The goal of this project is to create a new tab, \'93Flight Planner,\'94 on my personal website. The goal of this tab is to help pilots of small aircraft select the optimal altitude for an upcoming flight, based on their direction of flight, their expected airspeed, and the weather forecast. The tab has these inputs: Departure airport, destination airport, expected indicated airspeed (IAS), departure date and time, minimum allowed altitude, maximum allowed altitude, a checkbox for \'93VFR altitudes\'94, and a button labeled \'93Plan.\'94 The plan button should only be clickable when the other inputs have been filled in. When the user clicks \'93Plan,\'94 the optimal altitude for getting to the destination as quickly as possible should be calculated and displayed to the user. Maximum allowed altitude should be defaulted to 10,000 feet. The VFR altitudes checkbox should be checked by default. Minimum allowed altitude should be defaulted to 2,000 feet.\
\
The calculation should work as follows: The latitude and longitude of the departure and destination airport should be looked up from a publicly accessible dataset. The pilot\'92s course (relative to true north) should then be determined. Winds and temperatures aloft for the region(s) in which the flight will take place should be downloaded from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://aviationweather.gov/data/windtemp/"}}{\fldrslt https://aviationweather.gov/data/windtemp/}}; select the forecast that is closest to the pilot\'92s planned departure time. Use the low altitude dataset. Use the \'93raw\'94 dataset. Download a few example datasets and look at the \'93valid\'94 and \'93for use from x to x\'94 data to figure out how to pick the correct forecast hour based on the pilot\'92s inputs. Here is how to read this data: If a cell for a given airport code and altitude has 4 digits, for example 3315, that means the wind is coming from true heading 330, at 15 knots. If there are 6 digits, for example 2613-17, it means that the wind is coming from true heading 260, at 13 knots, and the air temperature is -17C. Note that at the top of the forecast it says that temperatures are negative above certain altitudes; in those cases, all temperatures should be assumed to be negative even if they do not have a negative sign.\
\
We now know the pilot\'92s direction of flight, the distance that needs to be flown, and the winds and temperatures at different altitudes along the pilot\'92s route. Next, we need to calculate the pilot\'92s expected groundspeed along the route, for each altitude in 1000-foot increments between the minimum and maximum allowed altitudes. If the VFR box is checked, the attitudes should end in 500 feet; otherwise, they should be even thousands. Here is how to calculate groundspeed given wind, indicated airspeed, altitude, and temperature: First, indicated airspeed needs to be converted to true airspeed using the ISA model, which requires the ground-level altimeter setting, temperature, indicated airspeed, and altitude. Altimeter settings can be gotten from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://aviationweather.gov/data/metar/"}}{\fldrslt https://aviationweather.gov/data/metar/}}. A description of how to calculate true airspeed given these inputs can be found at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.aviationhunt.com/airspeed-conversion-calculator/"}}{\fldrslt https://www.aviationhunt.com/airspeed-conversion-calculator/}}. Once we have the true airspeed, groundspeed can be calculated by applying trigonometric rules to the wind speed, wind direction, true airspeed, and flight direction. Search the internet for \'93wind triangle\'94 if it\'92s not clear how to do this. \
\
Once the groundspeed has been computed along the pilot\'92s route for different altitudes, find the altitude that results in the fastest average groundspeed, and display that. Provide a toggle labeled \'93Show computations,\'94 which defaults to off. If it is selected, all of the intermediate results and raw data should be displayed, so that the work can be checked and debugged.\

Ask follow-up questions as needed. Do not break existing website functionality. Ask me if you need help understanding the format of any relevant aviation data. When you need to find a data source that I haven\'92t already mentioned, clearly state which data source you are picking so that I can verify its validity.}
